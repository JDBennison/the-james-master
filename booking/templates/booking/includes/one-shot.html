    <p>We assume you have a basic familiarity with Dungeons and Dragons so we can get down to the important stuff. Choose from any published module, create a custom adventure, or take a chance and let me choose for you based on your character choices.</p>
    <p>We will have a lot of different characters for you to choose from but if there is something in particular you would like to play then make sure to contact the Dungeon Master ahead of time so they can prepare it for you!</p>
    <p>Your session will last around 4-5 hours and if it is your first time you will also get a set of dice to keep!</p>
